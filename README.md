# TwitterHashflagDump
When you load Twitter, it pulls in a json file filled with all of the active "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hashflag">hashflag</a>" campaigns. These are the festive emoji they put after hashtags.

This grabs the current one and generates an HTML file with the campaign entries and the hashflag images associated with them.
